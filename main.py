            The Prophet model applied to box office earnings in these graphs shows a strong upward trend in revenue over time, especially noticeable after the 1990s. The trend component reveals a steady increase, which accelerates sharply in recent years, suggesting that box office earnings have grown significantly, potentially due to factors like higher ticket prices, a greater number of releases, or increased global demand. The yearly seasonality plot highlights cyclic fluctuations in earnings, with peaks and troughs within each year, possibly aligned with major film release periods like summer and the holiday season. Prophet‚Äôs forecast with confidence intervals (in blue) indicates anticipated continued growth with periodic variations, showing Prophet's ability to capture both long-term trends and seasonal effects in box office revenue.

            The LSTM model's charts for box office earnings show a strong upward trend captured in both historical data predictions and future forecasts. The first chart illustrates a steep increase in projected earnings, suggesting the model has identified an accelerating growth trend, though it may overstate future earnings if unchecked by real-world constraints. The second chart, comparing actual and predicted values on test data, shows that the model successfully captures the overall upward trajectory but overestimates earnings in some areas, indicating it could benefit from further tuning to handle short-term fluctuations. Overall, the model is effective but may need adjustments for greater accuracy in near-term predictions.

# Time Series System
The ARIMA and Prophet models offer valuable insights into the forecast of box office earnings, each with unique strengths. ARIMA‚Äôs linear approach effectively captures steady trends, providing a straightforward outlook based on historical data. However, it may miss out on more complex, non-linear patterns often present in film industry revenues. Prophet, in contrast, incorporates seasonality and trend changes, capturing cyclical revenue fluctuations like those seen during holidays or blockbuster seasons. This makes Prophet particularly useful for predicting periods of increased or decreased revenue. Together, these models offer complementary perspectives, with ARIMA highlighting overall trends and Prophet providing nuanced, seasonally-adjusted forecasts. Leveraging both models can enhance strategic decision-making for release timing and revenue optimization.

The time series model we created, using linear regression, is designed to predict future box office earnings based on historical data. By treating Release Year as the time-dependent feature and Box Office Earnings as the target variable, we can establish a trend over time and generate projections for future years.

 This approach is particularly useful for capturing long-term trends in movie earnings, reflecting the impact of factors like industry growth, inflation, and audience demand over time. Although linear regression provides a straightforward estimation, it‚Äôs especially valuable here due to the consistent time-based structure of our data. However, if additional features like Genre, Budget, or Director Box Office % were incorporated in a multivariate time series model, we could gain insights into how specific characteristics influence earnings trends, enhancing the model's ability to predict outcomes more accurately by accounting for these other key factors.


## Clustering Systems
The analysis of the relationship between movie budgets and IMDb scores, following clustering, reveals no significant correlation between the two variables. The initial scatterplot shows that a large financial investment does not guarantee a high IMDb score. This observation suggests that audience impact and ratings are not directly influenced by budget alone. Furthermore, K-Means clustering showed no consistent pattern in IMDb scores, as both low and high-budget films exhibited a similar range of ratings. Therefore, while budget alone is not a reliable predictor of IMDb scores, incorporating other qualitative factors into the model may improve its ability to explain audience ratings more effectively.

    st.subheader("Recommender Systems")

    st.markdown("""
    The machine learning algorithm initially uses filters to only display movies of the same genre and prevent it from recommending the same movie. It uses a scoring system for select attributes where the score increases when a match is made with the original movie. After several models, the attributes and their scoring were decided after we were satisfied with the recommendations being given out.

    We gave more points if the director was a match because they often create similar movies or direct the movie's sequel if there are any. This is not a limitation however as you can see in the 4th example with "Harry Potter" as the directors change frequently.

    A known limitation with the recommender system however, is that because we filtered out other genres, it is impossible for other genres to be recommended even if they are part of the same franchise/series,are directed by the same person, and they feature the same actors.

    One example is Big Momma's House and Big Momma's House 2, an action comedy featuring Martin Lawrence. Because the two movies are labeled action and comedy, respectively, in the dataset, the algorithm will not recommend the sequel when prompted because of the different genre. We believe the fix to this is by allowing multiple genres in the same manner as how actors are listed (actor 1, actor 2, actor 3).""")
